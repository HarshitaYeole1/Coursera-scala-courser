  /*
  Write a recursive function that
  counts how many different ways you can make change for an amount, given a list of coin denominations.
  For example,
  there are 3 ways to give change for 4 if you have coins with denomination 1 and 2: 1+1+1+1, 1+1+2, 2+2.

  Do this exercise by implementing the countChange function inMain.scala.
  This function takes an amount to change, and a list of unique denominations for the coins.

  Once again, you can make use of functions isEmpty, head and tail on the list of integers coins.

  Hint: Think of the degenerate cases.
  How many ways can you give change for 0 CHF(swiss money)?
  How many ways can you give change for >0 CHF, if you have no coins?
